# Handwritten-digit-prediction
A Flask web application that predicts handwritten digits. Users can either draw digits on a canvas or upload an image. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., MNIST) to make predictions. This project combines Flask, machine learning, and interactive web features for real-time digit recognition.
